SWIS (Smart water conservation and irrigation system) are a project submitted in Rajasthan_it_day
In this project we create a prototype (by use of IOT) for farmers, which collect the information on humidity, soil moisture and temperature and all this data goes into a database 
 The farmer can access the details of the field statistic from his smartphone 
We show all the statistic in form of line graphs and if soil moisture the farmer get the message and he/she can start the water pump remotely by using internet connection
